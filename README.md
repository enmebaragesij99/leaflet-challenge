# Leaflet-challenge

This is my Module 15-Leaflet challenge, which consists of one HTML file, one JavaScriptfile and a CSS file. All the files work together in unison to build a worldwide 
earthquake visualisation.

## Contents

- index(HTML file)

- style(CSS file)

- logic(JavaScript file)

-  https://enmebaragesij99.github.io/leaflet-challenge/ (app which can be deployed via GitHub Pages)

## About

-Dataset was retrieved using D3 from USGS GeoJSON Feed, specifically M2.5+ Earthquakes the past day.

-A map was created using leaflet to plot all earthquake data from dataset.

-Markers were created for each earthquake from the dataset. Size corresponding to the earthquake magnitude, the colour corresponding to the depth of the earthquake 
and each marker has a tooltip with the magnitude, location(place was used as the location from the dataset) and depth. 

-A legend was created showing the depth and their corresponding colour.

-An app which can be deployed via the above link in the Contents section via GitHub Pages




Note; I did receive guidance from an a LA on how to create a legend for this challenge.
